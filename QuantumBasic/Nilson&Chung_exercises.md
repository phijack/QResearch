##Chapter 2

**Exercise 2.24** Show that a positive operator is necessarily Hermitian.

## Chapter 4

**Exercise 4.4** Express the Hadamard gate $H$ as a product of $R_x$ and $R_z$ rotations and $e^{i\varphi}$ for some $\varphi$.

Solution: $H = e^{i\frac{\pi}{2}}R_z(\frac{\pi}{2})R_x(\frac{\pi}{2})R_z(\frac{\pi}{2})$. Basic thoughts are Hadamard gate is a change from z-axis to x-axis. $R_x(\theta)$ is a rotation with x-axis as the axis and $R_z(\theta)$ is a rotation with z-axis as the axis.
